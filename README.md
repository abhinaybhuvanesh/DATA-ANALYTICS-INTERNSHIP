# DATA-ANALYTICS-INTERNSHIP

"COMPANY": CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

"NAME": THOTA ABHINAY BHUVANESH 

"INTERN ID": CTIS1514

"DOMAIN:: Data Analytics

"DURATION": 6 WEEKS

"MENTOR": NEELA SANTOSH

"DATASET SOURCE": AMAZON SALES DATASET - KAGGLE

TASK 1 – Data Analysis

"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I performed data analysis using Python in Google Colab. I selected an Amazon Sales dataset from Kaggle and uploaded it into Colab. The dataset was loaded using the pandas library, and initial exploration was carried out to understand the dataset structure, columns, and data types. Data cleaning was performed by converting price values, discount percentages, ratings, and rating counts into numeric formats by removing currency symbols and percentage signs and handling missing or invalid values safely. After cleaning, exploratory analysis was conducted to study category-wise product distribution, average product ratings, discount patterns, and comparisons between actual and discounted prices. The complete analysis was documented in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to GitHub as part of the internship submission.

TASK 2 – Predictive Analysis

"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I performed predictive analysis using Python in Google Colab. I used the same Amazon Sales dataset to build a simple prediction model. The dataset was cleaned by converting price values, discount percentages, ratings, and rating counts into numeric formats and removing rows with missing values. Relevant features such as actual price, discounted price, discount percentage, and rating count were selected as input variables, and product rating was chosen as the target variable. The data was split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model was trained using scikit-learn. The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. The complete predictive analysis process and results were saved in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to GitHub as part of the internship tasks.

TASK 3 – Interactive Dashboard Development

"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I developed an interactive data visualization dashboard using Tableau Public. The same Amazon Sales dataset used in the previous tasks was imported into Tableau for visualization. Multiple worksheets were created to represent key insights, including category-wise product count, average product rating by category, and the relationship between discount percentage and product rating. Appropriate chart types such as bar charts and scatter plots were used to clearly present the data. Filters and interactive elements were added to enable users to explore the data dynamically across different categories. All the worksheets were combined into a single interactive dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of sales and rating trends. The final dashboard was published on Tableau Public, and the dashboard link was included as part of the internship submission for evaluation.

TASK 4 – Sentiment Analysis

"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I performed sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python with Google Colab. An Amazon product reviews dataset was selected from Kaggle and uploaded into the Colab environment for analysis. The dataset was loaded using the pandas library, and initial exploration was carried out to understand the structure of the text data and relevant columns. Data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, lowercasing, removal of punctuation and special characters, and handling of missing values were performed to prepare the review text for analysis. Sentiment analysis was then implemented to classify customer reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral using NLP techniques and a sentiment analysis model. The results were analyzed to understand overall customer sentiment patterns and product feedback trends


"Overall Learnings & Conclusion": 
Through this Data Analytics internship, I gained hands-on experience across the complete data analytics workflow, starting from data collection and cleaning to analysis, modeling, visualization, and interpretation. I strengthened my practical skills in Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data analysis and predictive modeling. I also learned how to convert raw datasets into meaningful insights using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. Additionally, building an interactive dashboard using Tableau Public helped me understand the importance of data visualization and storytelling for effective decision-making. The sentiment analysis task introduced me to Natural Language Processing concepts and real-world text data handling. Overall, this internship enhanced my analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and confidence in working with real-world datasets.
